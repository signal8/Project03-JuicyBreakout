# Project03-JuicyBreakout

# Br3@k-0uT (idk i'm bad at naming things)
February 23, 2024. A Breakout clone with added "Juice". Done entirely in Visual Scripting to focus on game feel and polish.

Use WASD to move the paddle (more like A and D), and Space to launch the ball. Don't let the ball into the pit, or you'll lose a life. Lose three lives and it's game over!

## Implementation
 - Updated the colors
 - Shake the screen when breaking a brick
 - Added Sound effects
 - Added Music
 - Made the elements rotate when hit
 - Added particles to a hit element
 - Animated elements at the start of the levels.
 - Added Comet Trail to the ball.
 - Added Fades in-between levels
 - Added Glows to as much as I could.
